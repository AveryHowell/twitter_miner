# Twitter Miner

## Example

`python twitter_miner.py 'debate_tweets' \#hillary \#trump`

This will mine tweets which use `#hillary` and `#trump` and save them `debate_tweets_[current date and time].csv`.

_Note that if you want to mine hashtags, you have to use \ to escape the # in the command line_
